Description
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. 
Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at?

----------------------------------------------------------

1. Open the website
    - https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/15796/
    - we should login as Joe
        - try entering 'Joe' with blank password
            - "I'm sorry Joe's password is super secure. You're not getting in that way."
    - try login as someone else
        - 'Tester' with blank PW
            - success, but no flag obtained
        - we can login as everyone else except of Joe who seems to store flag behind the login 
    - lets INSPECT THE CODE to find something about Joe
        - no info about this account
        
2. Obtain the flag
    - when logging under different usernames, we are not logged in as 'admin'
    - lets change this value for a moment
    - login as any user
        - username: 'Tester'
        - password: 'test'
        
        - after successful login, we need to change our admin state from False to True
            - F12 -> Storage -> Cookies -> admin=False
                - rewrite False to True
            - reload the page (F5)
                - we obtained the flag :-)
