Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: 
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/ (link) 
or 
http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Open the website
    - https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/
    - just a short one-page info website with no visible flag


2. Inspect the code
    - F12
        - Inspector
            - search for 'picoCTF'
                - we found the 1/3 of a flag...
                    -  Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 
                    - it seems we need to find 2 more pieces...
                    
        - Debugger
            - problem/44924 -> myjs.js
                - we found the 3/3 of a flag...
                    - Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?f10be399}
               
        - it seems it has something to do with frontend of the website
            - there stands "How" where are 3 parts which is website build from
                - HTML (found), CSS (not yet), JS (found)
                    - lets search for CSS part in code to find the third part...
                    
        - Style Editor
            - mycss.css
                - You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t
                
3. Obtaing the flag
    - put all three part in correct order together
        1/3 = picoCTF{tru3_d3
        2/3 = t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t
        3/3 = _lucky?f10be399}
    - we got the correct flag :-)
