    - lets use useful stego tool in linux
        - if you dont have it installed, use this command:
            - sudo apt-get install binwalk
    - BINWALK
        - binwalk -e garden.png
            - -e for extracting all the stuff from our suspicious file
            - 2 results
                - JPEG image with JFIF standard
                - Copyright string

4. Hex editor
    - Hint under this challenge tells us: 
        - What is a hex editor?
        - lets try to inspect the file with hex editor
    - there are many hex editors for linux
        - we can use Hexedit
            - it is fast and simple
            - works via Terminal
            
5. Hexedit
    - sudo apt-get install hexedit
    - hexedit garden.png
        - loooong output
        - lets jump to the end of the file
            - MANUALLY: hold 'END' keyboard
            - jump out of the command and run: xxd garden.jpg
                - to copy it better, use strings command
                    - strings garden.jpg
                        - we obtained the flag :-)
