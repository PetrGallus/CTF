1. Download given input file

2. Open it in Wireshark to inspect network traffic log
    - we can see nearly 1000 packets overall
        - 23 seconds
        - protocols: ARP, HTTP, TCP, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3
        - conversations
            - menu -> Statistics -> Conversations
            - ETH: 4
            - IPv4: 4
            - TCP: 17
            - IPv4 ... data sent from 103 to 104 (3rd line) are largest 
                - 1433 kB of data transmitted, most of the from A to B
                    - from 192.168.38.103 to 192.168.38.104
                        - lets look at these
                        
3. Filter IP addresses with biggest data transmitted
    - ip.src==192.168.38.103 && ip.dst==192.168.38.104
        - right click -> Apply as filter -> Selected -> A->B
    - no info inside
    
4. Filter the first one in order
    - 18.222.37.134 && 192.168.38.104
        - right click -> Apply as filter -> Selected -> A <-> B
            - ip.addr==18.222.37.134 && ip.addr==192.168.38.104
                - there is one GET / HTTP request...
                    - right click -> Follow -> HTTP Stream
                        - last line
                            - Gur synt vf cvpbPGS{c33xno00_1_f33_h_qrnqorrs}
                                - looks line a flag, but in weird order

    - try some kind of ROT :-)
        - we obtained the flag
