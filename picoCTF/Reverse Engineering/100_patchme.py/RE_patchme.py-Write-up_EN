Description
Can you get the flag? 
Run this Python program in the same directory as this encrypted flag.
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Download given two files 


2. Flag file contains some kind of bad readable data


3. patchme.flag.py
    - def str_xor(secret, key):
        - first function just adds chars to the key to get the necesary length and makes it decryptable
    - flag_enc = open('flag.txt.enc', 'rb').read()
        - opens the flag containing file        
    - def level_1_pw_check():
        - very important part containing hint how to obtain flag
            - we need to enter the given password to run the function
                - def level_1_pw_check():
                
4. Run the python script
    - Please enter correct password for flag:
        - lets enter the PW value from the code
            - ak98-=90adfjhgj321sleuth9000
    - voila, we got the flag :-)
    
    
5. BONUS
    - we could also do it 2 another ways:
    5.1 Change password value to something shorter we want
        - line 19 : if( user_pw == "picoCTF"):
        - run the script and enter 'picoCTF' value as PW to obtain the flag
    5.2 Ignore whole function level_1_pw_check():
        - just copy the function calling the str_xor out of the function and delete it
        -   decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), "utilitarian")
            print(decryption)
