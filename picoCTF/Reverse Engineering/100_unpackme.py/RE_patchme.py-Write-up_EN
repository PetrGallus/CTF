Description
Can you get the flag? 
Reverse engineer this Python program.
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Download given input file 


2. Inspect the code of unpackme.flag.py
    - it imports base64 and Fernet crypto
    - payload is some value represented as a byte string
    - key_str is value for encoding key
    - key_base64 encodes the key into base64
    - plain.decode decodes the decrypted payload value with Fernet using key
    
3. Run the script
    - it asks us for the password which we dont know, it is not even mentioned in the code
    - if we delete the 'exec' from the last line and just run the plain.decode(), nothing happens 
    
    
4. Get rid of exec
    - we dont know if its some kind of malware so we dont wanna execute the python script
        - sufficient would be to just print it out
            - instead of exec(plain.decode()) use print(plain.decode())
    - run it
        - it was easier than expected, here we go, the flag:
            pw = input('What\'s the password? ')

            if pw == 'batteryhorse':
            print('picoCTF{flag - run it yourself}')
            else:
            print('That password is incorrect.')
