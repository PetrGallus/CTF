## Binary Exploitation
### two sum
>flag: picoCTF{Tw0_Sum_Integer_Bu773R_0v3rfl0w_4b563da7}

steps:
1. Run the instance && download given source file
2. Connect to the given IP via terminal
3. Inspect the source code of the app
    - we have to obtain both num1 and num2 > 0, but there is only =0 and =-1 defined
    - lets overflow the int values
        - according in C the maximum size of a signed int is INT_MAX = 2147483647
4. Run the app in terminal and enter num1 and num2 value: 2147483647

### babygame01 {WIP}
>flag: picoCTF{gamer_m0d3_enabled_0a880baf}

steps:
1. Run the instance && run the game with nc saturn.picoctf.net <port>
2. map, by entering w/a/s/d you can move as a @, goal is to get to the X at position 29 89
3. strings game
    - there is flag.txt file
    - many useful commands to use, lets try them
4. run the game and try:
    - print flag  (gets us to the end automatically)
    - print flag.txt (now working, same as previous)
    - 
5. Disassembly the game file
    - open it in Ghidra
    - inspect the functions
        - _fini function works with flag.txt file
            - address: 0804a00a
6. run the game to solve the flag
    - a a a a
    - w w w w w
        - we occured on the top left
    - a a a ... until we obtain "Player has flag: 64"
    - l -> Player has flag: 10
    - p -> end of the game, we obtained the flag
### hijacking
>flag: 

steps:
1. Run the instance && run the game with nc saturn.picoctf.net <port>
        -  ssh picoctf@saturn.picoctf.net -p64707
2. ls, whoami, ls -al
3. sudo -l
    - we can run some /home/picoctf/.server.py
        - sudo vi .server.py
4. Edit .server.py file
    - ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r18vB9q4h.png)
    - sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/picoctf/.server.py
        - we obtained root access
5. Search for the flag
    - whoami, ls
    - cd /root
        - ls -al
        - cat .flag.txt
